This is a simple tool to evaluate a list of ICD-10 codes against DCS/DChS coding standards.

## Installation

You can install the development version directly from GitHub with:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/KeironO/coding-errors --no-cache-dir
```


## Usage

```python
>>> from codingerrors import run
>>> run(["J440", "J22"])
{'DCS.X.5:0': {'!': {'pass': False, 'relevant': ['J22']}}}
```
